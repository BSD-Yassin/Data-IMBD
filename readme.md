# Data IMDB-API


Since IMDB API [is a thing](https://imdb-api.com/API), I wanted to test a simple theory, that everbody has thought of at least once : 

For a movie that's come out in the current times, the rating only increases as more people get to watch it until it's forgotten enough to have less "idealised" ratings.

So this code simply gets the same data, every day, at the same time and writes in a folder, in a file. I will soon trying to process the data after a few days worth.
